Encapsulation- bundling data with methods that can operate on that data within a class
hiding data within a class, preventing anything outside that class from directly interacting with it 

-method- functions defined within the class
members of other classes can interact with the attributes of another object through its methods

-2 Types
1) Getting methods- retrieving data 
ex: get color for chess piece
2) Setting methods- changing information

-If you want some attributes to be read only, you would define a getter method but not a setter method
-It is best practice to not allow anything external to directly edit an objects attributes

Encapsulation:
-keeps programmers in control of access to data
-prevents the program from ending up in strange or unwanted states
