Inheritance - principle that allows classes to derive from other classes.
classes can inherit certain methods and attributes from other classes 

-Class hierarchy- acts as a web of classes with different relationships to one another 

-Access modifiers- change which classes have access to other classes, methods or attributes
3 Main Access Modifiers
1) Public- can be accessed anywhere in your program
2) Private- can only be accessed from within the same class that the members are defined 
(best used if information not needed anywhere else)
(private methods can have the same name in separate classes)
3) Protected- can be accessed within the class it is defined, as well as any subclasses of that class
