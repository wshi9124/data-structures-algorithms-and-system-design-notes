Primative data types store single values

Examples include:
-Byte
-Int
-Float
-Boolean
-Double
-Char

Good for early programs, but as programs began to grow larger and more complex, using primative data types were not sufficient anymore

↓

Structure- stores many pieces of data together 
-similar to array however structures can store different types of data together while arrays can't
-main issue with structures is that you cannot define within one, you can only reference them

object orientated programming solves this problem

↓
Object orientated programming- helps programmers create complex programs by grouping together related data and functions 

Objects- instances of a class
- classes are a template for an object

Ex: knight on a chess board
class- represents any given knight (how they move)
object- represents only one singular knight (position, color)
