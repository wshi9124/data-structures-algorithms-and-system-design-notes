data structure- a way to store information while programming.
It is a collection of values and the format they are stored in, the relationships between the values in the collection,
as well as the operations applied on the data stored in the structure 

Operations:
1) Access and read values 
2) Search for arbitrary values
3) Insert values at any point in the structure 
4) Delete values in the structure 

Contiguous data structure- data stored in blocks of memory that are beside each other with no gaps
(retrieving the values are easy)
Non Contiguous data structute- structure that stores a value along with a reference to where the next value is 
(increases runtime)

Homogeneous data structureâ€“ Data elements will be of same data type
Heterogenous data structure- Data elements may not be of same data type 


Types of data structure:

1) array- Contiguous data structure with no gaps 
Uses index to access values 
*called list in python array is sometihng else in python*
*lists are homogeneous*
