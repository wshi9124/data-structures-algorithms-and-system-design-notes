data structure- a way to store information while programming.
It is a collection of values and the format they are stored in, the relationships between the values in the collection,
as well as the operations applied on the data stored in the structure 

Operations:
1) Access and read values 
2) Search for arbitrary values
3) Insert values at any point in the structure 
4) Delete values in the structure 

Contiguous data structure- data stored in blocks of memory that are beside each other with no gaps
(retrieving the values are easy)
Non Contiguous data structute- structure that stores a value along with a reference to where the next value is 
(increases runtime)

Homogeneous data structureâ€“ Data elements will be of same data type
Heterogenous data structure- Data elements may not be of same data type 

Self Referential Object- structures that have one or more pointers which point to the same type of structure, as their member.

Types of data structure:

1) Array- Contiguous data structure with no gaps 
In python the values are not stored in memory, instead the array only stores the references to the values 
Uses index to access, insert, update and delete values 
*called list in python array is sometihng else in python*
*lists in python are heterogenous*

2) Linked List- linear data structure where each element in the list is contained in a separate object called a node
Node- models 2 pieces of information, an individual item of the data we want to store and a reference to the next node in the list 
The first node of a linked list is the head and the last node is the tail
list only makes a reference to the head although in some implementations they also keep reference to the tail as well
Self Referencial Object- definition of node is includes the node itself
Better at inserting and deleting than arrays 
2 Types of Linked List
1) Singly Linked List- each node stores a reference to the next node in the list  
2) Doubly Linked List- each node stores a reference to both the node before and after the list
