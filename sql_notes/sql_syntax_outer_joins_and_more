OUTER JOIN is used instead of INNER JOIN when you want to see all the data even if the data is null

Left Join- when we use left join, all the records from the left table are returned wheather the condition is true or not 
Right Join- when we use right join, all the records from the right table are returned wheather the condition is true or not 
(You can write LEFT OUTER JOIN or RIGHT OUTER JOIN, however, they are optional)

ex:
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    o.order_id
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o
    ON c.customer.id = o.customer_id
Order BY c.customer_id

You can also join from multiple tables 
However avoid using Right Joins

Just like self inner joins you can do self outer joins 

1) USING clause
If the column name is exactly the same across two tables that are joining you can simplify:

ex: ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id 
is the same as 
USING (customer_id)

You can use the USING clasue on both inner and outer joins 

2) NATURAL JOIN- we dont specify the column name, but the database engine will look at the 2 tables and join 
them based on common columns  
However, they are not recommended because they can produce unexpected results

ex: SELECT 
    o.order_id
    c.first_name
FROM orders o 
NATURAL JOIN customers c 

3) CROSS JOIN- used to join every record from the first table, with every record in a second table. 
Used to find every combination of results 

ex: SELECT 
        c.first_name AS customer
        p.name AS product
    FROM customers c 
    CROSS JOIN products p
    ORDER BY c.c.first_name

is the same as 

SELECT 
        c.first_name AS customer
        p.name AS product
    FROM customers c, products p
    ORDER BY c.c.first_name
