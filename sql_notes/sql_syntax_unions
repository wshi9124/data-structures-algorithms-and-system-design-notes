UNIONS- used to combine rows from multiple tables 
Number of columns each query returns has to be equal or there will be an error 
Whatever you name in the first query will be the name of the columns

ex: 
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    first_name,
    points,
    "Bronze" AS type
FROM customers
WHERE points < 2000
UNION
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    first_name,
    points,
    "Silver" 
FROM customers
WHERE points BETWEEN 2000 AND 3000
UNION
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    first_name,
    points,
    "Gold"
FROM customers
WHERE points > 3000
ORDER BY first_name
