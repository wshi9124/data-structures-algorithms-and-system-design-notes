Distributed Cache- Works the same way as traditional cache.
Has built in functionality to replicate data, shard data across servers, and locate proper server for each key.
Used for reliability and redundency. 
Ideally you do not have to use your backup caches, but it is there just in case your active ones goes down. 
It is good for backups to "warm-up" or pre-query the database so backup caches can fill up.

Cache Eviction- Needed for 2 reasons 
-Preventing stale data.
-Caching only the most valuable data to save resources 

1) TTL (Time to live)- set a time period before a cache is deleted.
Used to prevent stale data.
Time that you set depends on how essential it is for data to be fresh. 
 
2) LRU (Least Recently Used)- Once cache is full remove last accessed key and add new key.

3) LFU (Least Frequently Used)- Tracks number of time a key is accessed, drops least used when cache is full.

Ex: a tweet from an account with 10 followers during 2010 vs a tweet yesterday from an account with millions of followers
