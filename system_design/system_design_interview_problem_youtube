Capacity Estimates
1) Storage- 500 hours of video uploaded per minute 
500 hours * 60 = 30,000 minutes of video per minute
30,000 * 50mb // 1000 = 1500GB uploaded per minute
1500 * 60 * 24 // 1000 = 2160 TB per day or 2.16 PB per day

2) Bandwidth- 1 Billion hours of video watched per day
1000000000 * 3GB per hour // 10000 = 3000000 PB bandwidth/day

System Architecture- refer to system architecture image 
-Client- user on phone, desktop, tv, etc.

-CDN (content distribution network)- where most popular videos are being served from to reduce latency

-Web server- acts as a load balancer and distribute traffic evenly to our multiple app servers in the back ground  

-App server- it is what is going to be talking (brains of the application)

-Processing queue- gives durability in the video upload process (if any part of the upload process fails, it can retry again)

-Video upload servers- thumbnail generation, precreate files for every video format 

-Video object storage- open source or amazon s3 

-User data/Video Metadata- used for when user searches for videos
