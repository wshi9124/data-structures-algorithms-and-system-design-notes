System Design- the process of designing the architecture, components, and interfaces for a system so that it meets the end-user requirements.

Distributed System- computing environment in which various components are spread across multiple computing devices on a network. 
These devices split up the work, coordinating their efforts to complete the job more efficiently 
than if a single device had been responsible for the task.
Whenever its possible we should avoid using distributed systems. 
All the complexity should be hidden from the user. 

Things that can go wrong in a distributed system:
1) Client cant find the server- client sends request but server not responding. 
2) Server crash mid request- you do find request but while it is processing the server breaks down. 
3) Server response is lost- server has a response but the network fails when sending data back to client
(server thinks its done its job but client still doesnt have a response).
4) Client crashes- when client breaks and server has nothing to send data back to.

Benefits of distributed systems:
1) More reliable, fault tolerant- if your running on a single machine if that does down, whole system goes down.
2) Scalability- you can add more machines or nodes to scale up.
3) Lower Latency, increase performance- you can run your applications out of multiple data centers (closer to user).
4) Cost effectivce- You can't buy a larger single machine, instead you can buy a lot of smaller ones.
