Distributed Systems Characteristics 

1) No shared clock- all the individual servers are running on their own time
Can lead to an issue call clock drift or when timers on each computer get out of sync 
That is why you need to synchronize your servers (very important for time sensitive servers like a stock trading site) 

2) No shared memory- Each node or server in your system has its own storage, so if it needs data 
from somewhere else it is going to have to request it from the part of the system that has it. 

3) Shared Resources- Anything in the distributed system should be able to be shared between nodes on the system.

4) Concurrency and Consistancy- different parts of the system are working together and at the same time.

5) Different parts of the distributed system need to be able to "talk" to each other. 
This requires an uniform format or protocol so different parts can understand each other.
