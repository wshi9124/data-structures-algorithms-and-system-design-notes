Load Balancers- Balance incoming traffic to multiple servers so that none of them are being overloaded or underutilized.
-Software (Nginx and HAProxy) or hardware (F5 and Citrix) based.
-Improves reliability and scalability. 
(ex: amazon adding servers for Chirstmas or scaling down during less busy times)
-In production, there are multiple load balancers so there is no single point of failure (active and passive load balancers). 

Load Balancing Routing Methods
1) Round Robin- when your load balancer has a list of servers available, and it will route them by cycling through each server.
-Simplest type of routing
-However it can result in uneven traffic becasue not all requests are them same, so some servers will do more work than others.

2) Least Connections- Routes are based on the number of client connections to server  
Good for chat and streaming applications where users are staying persistantly connected to the server. 

3) Least Response Time- Routes are based on how quickly servers respond 

4) IP Hash- Routes client or server based on IP
Useful for stateful sessions
(Ex shopping cart on Amazon)


2 Types of Load Balancers (Layer 4 vs Layer 7)
1) Layer 4- Only have access to TCP and UDP data 
-Simpler and faster becasue it doesnt have to use as much processing power to look at each request. 
-However, since it doesnt have access to all available information, it can lead to uneven traffic. 
-Good on edge of data center or network because it can look at IP address to address hackers.
-Good to route all incoming traffic through a layer 4 load balancer before allowing it further into your application.

2) Layer 7- Full access to HTTP protocol and data.
-Can terminate SSL and decrypt traffic.
-Can check for authentification.
-Smarter routing options.
-However, it is more CPU intensive.
