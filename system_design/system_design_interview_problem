Capacity Estimates
1) Storage- 500 hours of video uploaded per minute 
500 hours * 60 = 30,000 minutes of video per minute
30,000 * 50mb // 1000 = 1500GB uploaded per minute
1500 * 60 * 24 // 1000 = 2160 TB per day or 2.16 PB per day

2) Bandwidth- 1 Billion hours of video watched per day
1000000000 * 3GB per hour // 10000 = 3000000
