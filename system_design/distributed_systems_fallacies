Fallacies of Distributed Systems- False assumptions that programmers new to distributed systems make 

1) Network is reliable- Not true becasue there are many machines talking to each other 

2) Latency is Zero- Never assume that there is no delay between data being sent and data being received
because latency is determined by distance and speed of light.

3) Bandwidth is infinite- Never assume that the amount of data that can transfered is infinite.

4) The network is secure- always design systems to make sure the network is as secure as possible.

5) Topology doesn't change- topology refers to the manner in which the links and nodes of a network are arranged and relate to each other.
This changes all the time because servers get brought up, rearranged, and updated all the time. 
 
6) There is only one administrator- there will always be multiple people working on the system and managing it.

7) Transport cost is zero- The bigger the network, the bigger the financial cost.
(Servers, network switches, load balancers, proxies, firewalls, operating and maintaining the network, making it secure, and staff).

8) The network is homogeneous- distributed systems need to integrate with multiple types of devices, adapt to various operating systems, work with different browsers, and interact with other systems.
