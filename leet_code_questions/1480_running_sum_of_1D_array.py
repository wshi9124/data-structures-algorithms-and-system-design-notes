"""
Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).

Return the running sum of nums.

Examples: 
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].

Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1].

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6

Time complexity is O(n) Linear time becasue we perfrom the same number of operations on each element 
Space complexity is O(1) Constant time
